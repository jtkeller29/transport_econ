# Maps of Boston
I am lucky that Boston - our most primary case study here at the GSD - is an inherently interesting subject for me, given that I've been living in the city longer than I've lived anywhere else in my adult life (6 years).

## Interactive map of vacant homes in Cambridge by census block (including point layer of trees)
This interactive map demonstrates the following skills: 

* Displaying data on an interactive map

## Isochrone map of travel time to Allston Village
This map has been cleaned up in Illustrator because it was included in my team's midterm presentation. 

It demonstrates the following skills:

* Displaying multiple vector layers on the same map
* Calculating and displaying accessibility, based on travel time

## Raster map of accessibility in Greater Boston
This map shows accessibility an accessibility score based on an continuous distance-decay function of the walking time to the nearest transit stop, decreasing exponentially with distance. 

It demonstrates the following skills:

* Converting between raster layers and vector layers
* Displaying raster data on a map

## Georeferenced map of 1905 Reykjavik, Iceland
The overlayed polygons designate current buildings in the city, juxtaposed against the city's development in 1905.

##  Spatial relationships maps
This map demonstrates the following skills:

* Calculating and displaying relationships among point and polygon layers based on distance
* Displaying multiple vector layers on the same map

And this one demonstrates the following:

* Aggregating point data to a layer of polygons
